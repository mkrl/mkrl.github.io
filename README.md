## A homepage of mine

Today is the era of previously unreachable download speeds, unlimited bandwidth and constantly increasing computing resources.
With an incredibly large amount of third-party JavaScript libraries we sometimes tend to forget how to write pure, simple and lightweight code for simple tasks.

This website is more of a personal reminder to myself: do not overcomplicate things.

### Stuff

[plainterm.js](https://github.com/mkrl/plainterm.js) - pure JS lightweight terminal "emulator"

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/) running [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) as build tools.

Modify source @ `/source/mkrl.[file_extention]`

Build with:

```
npm install
grunt
```

Check out the gruntfile for build steps details.
