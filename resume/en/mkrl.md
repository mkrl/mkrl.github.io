## INTERESTS

- GITHUB: GitHub git GitHub Flow GitHub API 
I use GitHub on a daily basis. Starting from my todo list and monitoring OSS I'm interested in, to contributing, working and sharing projects of my own.

- DIGITAL ART: drawing Photoshop illustration design 
I used to draw stuff in my spare time. This is how I originally came to the Web - as a designer.

- WATER DRINKING: health water 
I absolutely love drinks of a different kind. I enjoy good coffee on my lunch breaks but water is my №1 liquid source.
